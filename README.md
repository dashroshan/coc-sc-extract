## COC Extract SC

Python script to batch extract png image sprite sheets from `*tex.sc` files present inside the clash of clans game apk. You can also find all the pre-extracted images of coc apk v14.2 [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F1KJu3z6uaukIvrGeNh_-0FDrrvc8I0X?usp=sharing)

### Installation

This script uses a library called pylzham which require the ``Visual C++ build tools`` to install it through pip. To avoid complications, I recommend using Replit instead which is a free to use online IDE. Make an account on Replit and then [click here](https://repl.it/github/roshan1337d/cocExtractSC). Select the language as Python, enter ``python3 main.py`` in ``configure the run button`` field, and click done!

### Usage

1. Download the [Clash of Clans apk file](https://clash-of-clans.en.uptodown.com/android/download)
2. Use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or any similar tool to extract the apk.
3. Open `\assets\sc`
4. Upload the desired `...tex.sc` files into the `sc` folder on Replit.
5. Click `Run`

> You will find the extracted images inside the `png` folder.
