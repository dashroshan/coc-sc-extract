## COC Extract SC

A python script to batch extract PNG image sprite sheets from the ``...tex.sc`` files of the Clash of Clans game APK.

### Installation

This script uses a library called pylzham which requires ``Visual C++ build tools`` to install it through pip. To avoid complications, I recommend using Replit instead which is a free to use online IDE. Make an account on Replit and then [click here](https://repl.it/github/roshan1337d/cocExtractSC). Select the language as Python, enter ``python3 main.py`` in ``configure the run button`` field, and click done!

### Usage

1. Download the [Clash of Clans apk](https://clash-of-clans.en.uptodown.com/android/download) file.
2. Use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or any similar tool to extract the apk.
3. Open `\assets\sc`, upload the `...tex.sc` files that you want to extract into the `sc` folder in Replit, click `Run`.

The contents will be extracted as PNG files into the `png` folder.
